## Progress Log

### 2025-12-30

**Started**: Task 1 - Create multi-project concept

Creating directory structure and beginning concept development.

**Completed**: Task 1 - Multi-project concept

Created comprehensive concept document covering:

1. **Executive Summary** - Key objectives and overview
2. **Core Principles** - Workspace-first, backward compatibility, local-first
3. **Architecture** - Configuration hierarchy, workspace structure
4. **Use Cases** - Monorepo, microservices, library+consumers, multi-language
5. **Key Features** - Workspace commands, cross-project workflows, dependency awareness
6. **Implementation Phases** - 5 phases over ~13 versions
7. **Technical Considerations** - Path resolution, Git integration, config loading
8. **API Extensions** - REST endpoints, frontend integration
9. **Testing Strategy** - Unit, integration, E2E tests
10. **Migration Path** - Backward compatibility, conversion process
11. **Documentation Requirements** - New and updated docs
12. **Success Metrics** - Adoption, performance, satisfaction
13. **Risks & Mitigations** - Complexity, performance, configuration
14. **Future Enhancements** - Templates, plugins, remote workspaces
15. **Conclusion** - Summary and next steps
16. **References** - Links to related documentation

**Key Achievements:**

- ✓ Defined workspace-first architecture
- ✓ Created configuration schema
- ✓ Documented 4 major use cases
- ✓ Designed 5 implementation phases
- ✓ Specified technical approach
- ✓ Outlined testing strategy
- ✓ Provided migration path
- ✓ Identified risks and mitigations

**Supporting Documentation:**

- Created version structure (01_plan, 02_implement, 03_test, 04_review)
- Created goals.md with success criteria
- Created progress.md with summary
- Created test-plan.md with future testing approach
- Created review.md with quality assessment
- Created version.json and README.md

## Summary

Successfully created a comprehensive, implementable concept for multi-project capabilities. The concept provides:

- Clear architectural vision aligned with kaczmarek.ai-dev principles
- Practical implementation roadmap (5 phases)
- Detailed technical specifications
- Complete testing strategy
- User migration path
- Risk mitigation strategies

The concept is ready for implementation beginning in version 0-18.
