## Notes

This version builds on lessons learned from versions 0-3 through 0-6, particularly focusing on stability and user experience. The rejection of versions 0-3, 0-4, and 0-5 highlighted the need for more thorough planning and testing before major feature additions.

Key learnings applied:
- More comprehensive planning phase
- Earlier testing integration
- Better documentation from the start
- Incremental, validated improvements
- Focus on stability before new features
