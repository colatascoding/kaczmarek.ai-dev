## Context

Version 0-3 builds upon the solid foundation established in versions 0-1 and 0-2:

- **v0-1**: Core workflow orchestration, module system, review workflow
- **v0-2**: Testing framework, workflow execution enhancements, agent management, Claude API integration
- **v0-3**: Library system, version folder structure, enhanced modules, stabilization

This version addresses key architectural limitations identified in previous versions and sets the stage for more advanced features in future versions.
