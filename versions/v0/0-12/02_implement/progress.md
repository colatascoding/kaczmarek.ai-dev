# Progress Log - Version 0-12

## 2025-12-27

### Version Started

Starting version 0-12 with focus on stability, completeness, and polish.

### Planning Phase Completed

**Comprehensive Plan Generated**

Generated detailed goals document for version 0-12 based on:
- Analysis of current codebase structure
- Review of versions 0-1 through 0-11 (including rejected versions)
- Examination of recent commits and development patterns
- Assessment of implementation status and completion roadmap
- Evaluation of project principles and direction

**Key Findings from Analysis:**
1. **Planning Agent Issue**: Recent versions (0-5 through 0-11) have placeholder goals - planning agent leaves "Planning agent is generating goals..." without completion
2. **Version Rejections**: Multiple recent versions rejected (0-2, 0-3, 0-6, 0-8, 0-9) - suggests need for better workflow
3. **Recent Development Focus**: 
   - Version management improvements (rejection logic, auto-merge, planning agent integration)
   - Agent branch detection and management
   - Frontend UI enhancements (executions view, dashboards, wizards)
   - Library system for workflows, dashboards, templates
   - Decision management and polling
4. **Core Infrastructure**: Solid foundation with workflow engine, SQLite, modules, CLI, and UI

**Primary Objectives for 0-12:**
1. Fix Planning Agent Completion - Critical fix for placeholder goals issue
2. Stabilize Version Management - Complete lifecycle management system
3. Enhance Agent Execution - Better task parsing and more operations
4. Complete Library System - Production-ready workflows and templates
5. Frontend UX Polish - Better error handling and user feedback

**Estimated Scope**: Medium (2-3 weeks), Medium-High complexity

**Three-Phase Approach**:
- Phase 1 (Week 1): Investigation & Fixes - Focus on planning agent root cause and version management bugs
- Phase 2 (Week 2): Core Enhancements - Agent execution, library system, frontend polish
- Phase 3 (Week 3): Testing & Documentation - Integration tests, documentation updates, refinement
