# Version 0-6 Library

This directory contains version-specific workflows, dashboards, and templates created during version 0-6.

## Purpose

Some features may be experimental or version-specific during development. Items here can be:
- Promoted to the main library (`/library`) when stable
- Kept as version-specific implementations
- Deprecated if not needed in future versions

## Structure

```
library/
├── workflows/     - Version-specific workflows
├── dashboards/    - Version-specific dashboards
└── templates/     - Version-specific templates
```

## Graduation Criteria

Items graduate to main library when:
- Feature is stable and tested
- Documentation is complete
- No breaking changes expected
- Approved by maintainers

## Status

Directory created, will be populated during implementation if needed.
