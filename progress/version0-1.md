### Workflow Engine Implementation

**Goal**: Build core workflow orchestration system

**Actions taken**:
- Created SQLite database schema for workflow state
- Implemented YAML parser for workflow definitions
- Built workflow execution engine with step execution
- Created module system with dynamic loading
- Added system module (log, wait, error handling)
- Integrated with CLI (`kad workflow` commands)

**Verification**:
- Tested example workflow execution
- Verified database persistence
- Confirmed module loading works

**Notes**: Core engine is functional and ready for module expansion.

**Execution Workflow Execution**

- Extracted 4 next steps from review
- Created implementation plan with [object Object] tasks
- Generated implementation prompt

Next steps: Use the generated prompt with Cursor Chat or AI assistant to implement the features.
Then run tests and update progress/review files accordingly.
