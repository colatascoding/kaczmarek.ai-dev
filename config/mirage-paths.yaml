# Configuration for how kaczmarek.ai-dev locates and talks to your Mirage project.
#
# This file is intentionally simple and text-based so both humans and AI tools
# can read and modify it easily.

mirage:
  # Path to your Mirage repository root, relative to this kaczmarek.ai-dev repo.
  #
  # In your current setup, kaczmarek.ai-dev lives *inside* the Mirage repo at:
  #   /Users/kaczmarek/x/swietlik/swietlik.mirage/kaczmarek.ai-dev
  #
  # So the Mirage root is one level up.
  root: ".."

  # Optional: override build directory if different from the default "build".
  build_dir: "build"

  # Base URL for the Mirage Action Web API (ActionWebBridge).
  #
  # This assumes you start Mirage with the Action API enabled, e.g.
  #   ./launch.sh --action-api
  #
  # kaczmarek.ai-dev tools will use this as the default, but you can always
  # override it with CLI flags or environment variables.
  action_api_base_url: "http://localhost:4001"
